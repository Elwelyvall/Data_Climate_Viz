### Workflow explanation 
In this project I used the cartopy and xarray python libraries. Note that the cartopy library has a significant amount of dependencies, the easiest way to install it is through anaconda, where you will need to create a dedicated virtual environment that contains all the dependencies. As for the video ffmpeg formatting you will also need to install it with anacoda!
